Description: Django Pusher
        =============
        
        Django Pusher is an application that makes it easier to utilize pusher.com with reusable applications. It solves
        the problem of authentication of private/presence channels as well as helping to prevent namespace clashes.
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        Django Pusher provides a pusher object gotten by::
        
            from django_pusher.push import pusher
        
        ``pusher`` Mimics the Generic Python Library provided by pusher.com except it adds a ``register`` and ``unregister`` command.
